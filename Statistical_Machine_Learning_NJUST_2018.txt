Advanced Statistical Analysis (Statistical Machine Learning) at NJUST, Autumn 2018

Classes time: Tuesday morning 08:00~08:45, 08:50~09:35, 09:40~10:25, 10:40~11:25 (180 minutes) and Wednesday night 19:00~19:45, 19:50~20:35, 20:45~21:25 (135 minutes)

Textbook: Kuhn, M. and Johnson, K. (2013). Applied Predictive Modeling. Springer, New York. ISBN 978-1-4614-6848-6.

The course is designed as the basic machine learning course for non-IT majoring students. The format of this course will be lecture and class discussion and the course material will be divided into three units: 1) Unsupervised Learning, 2) Supervised Learning, and 3) Parameters Tuning and Ensemble Learning. Enrolled students are under the assumption that the basic statistics and matrix algebra have been completed before taking this course.
